# 4.3
## 4.3.1 Intro to network analysis
- vertices/nodes (circles) are connected by edges (lines)
- the degree of a vertex is how many other vertexes it contains
- an edge describes two vertices
- a path is a sequence of unique, connected vertices
- a path describes the sequence of edges between two nodes (via other connected vertices if necessary)
- length of a path is number of edges
- a graph is 'connected' if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex
- a vertex is reachable if there is a path to it
- a disconnected graph has vertices that are not reachable
- a disconnected graph has multiple components that may be connected but there are no edges between the nodes in different components
- the size of a component is the number of nodes or vertices in it

## 4.3.2
- NetworkX changes!!!
- Previously, G.nodes() returned a list object, while now it returns a NodeView object. (See 1:46 in the video.)
- Previously, G.edges() returned a list object, while now it returns an EdgeView object. (See 3:35 in the video.)
- so be aware of the changes from the video!


## 4.3.3 Graph Visualistaion with NetworkX
- NetworkX comes with some data sets built in

## 4.3.4 random graphs
- simplest random graph model for network is the Erdos-Renyi or the ER graph model

- there are two parameters for a random graph model, N and p.
- N is the number of nodes and p is the probability for any two nodes to be connected by an edge
- so to implement you would go through every possible pair of nodes and with probabiliyt p insert an edge between them.
- consider eaxh pair of nodes once, independently of any other pair and, for example, flip a coin to see if they are connected.
- If the value of p is small typical graphs tend to be sparse having few edges
- large values of p mean the graph is densely connected
- the Nx lib includes an ER graph generator but we will write our own.
- The we would be able to implement a more complex network model of the kind not included in the Nx lib
- to implement the coin flip part we will import a fn from scipy stats

### pseudocode for the random graph generator
number of nodes, N = 20
probability of edge, p = 0.2

#create empty graph
#add all nodes in the graph
#loop over all pairs of nodes
          # add edge with probability p
