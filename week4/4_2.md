# 4.2.1 GPS tracking of birds
# 4.2.2 simple data vis
- huga data set. start by simply plotting lat and long of a flight trajectory for a single bird.
- lat and long are coords on a surface of a sphere though and we will be putting into a 2d plot so there will be severe distorions.
#4.2.3 plotting just with pandas (and examining flight speed) cf with pyplot
# 4.2.4 using datetime (and timestamps)
# calculating daily mean speed
# 4.2.6 cartopy library
