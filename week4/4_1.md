#4.1 pandas
oh god... more shitty pandas :(

- dataset contains a tasting rating for one readily available single malt whisky from almost every whisky distillery in scotland
- the data set contains 86 single malts
- htey are scored between 0 and 4 in 12 different taste categories, by 10 tatsters (and the score averages over the 10 tasters)
- categiries include sweet, spicy, smoky, medicinal etc
- pandas is for structured tabularised data
- two most important features are series and Dataframe
- series is a 1d array like object
- dataframe is a 2d, table like array-like object
- both contain additional info (metadata)as well as the data

questions: (just the one i got wrong)
In pandas , what does the reindex method do?
- Reorders the indices of a pandas Series object according to its argument

#4.1.2 loading and inspecting data
- change working ipython directory to file location helps
- can read data directly into a dataframe with pd.read_csv
#4.1.3 exploring correlations
- default correlation is the linear Pearson correlation 
- In other words, if you have measured attributes for two variables, let's call them x and y the Pearson correlation coefficient between x and y approaches plus 1 as the points in the xy scatterplot approach a straight upward line.
- a large +ve correlation coefficient indicates that x and y tend to increase or decrease togther so highly correlated.
/### Can use a single command to Compute pairwise the corerlation of columns in the flavors dataframe
- Assign output tp a variable called corr_flavors
- this one step makes a corelation matrix

```py
corr_flavors = pd.DataFrame.corr(flavors)
```
- can be used with transposed dataframes for other corellations in data:
```py
corr_whisky = pd.DataFrame.corr(flavors.transpose())
```
### how thsi works

Flavors was a reduced dataset containing 86 different flavor profiles. The colums were the flavors and the rows corresponded to each distillery. But. When we do a correlation on the transpose of  that what we get is 86 columns correspnding to each distillery with each row being a different flavor profile matrix:
In [128]: flavors.transpose()
Out[128]:

[12 rows x 86 columns]

- So now the corelation matrix will compare each distillery based on its flavor profile:

In [126]: corr_whisky.head()
Out[126]:
         0         1         2     ...           83        84        85
0  1.000000  0.708632  0.697354    ...     0.504753  0.572186  0.267222
1  0.708632  1.000000  0.503074    ...     0.631655  0.372342  0.483030
2  0.697354  0.503074  1.000000    ...     0.545891  0.358457  0.303273
3 -0.147311 -0.228591 -0.140435    ...    -0.392074  0.145517 -0.101649
4  0.731902  0.511834  0.557020    ...     0.424397  0.695182  0.424397

So you see that distilleries 0 and 1 have quite a similar flavor profile. 
But look at this slice: 

In [137]: corr_whisky.iloc[:5, :7]
Out[137]:
          0         1         2         3         4         5         6
0  1.000000  0.708632  0.697354 -0.147311  0.731902  0.389086  0.464312
1  0.708632  1.000000  0.503074 -0.228591  0.511834  0.400983  0.460830
2  0.697354  0.503074  1.000000 -0.140435  0.557020  0.389627  0.730465
3 -0.147311 -0.228591 -0.140435  1.000000  0.231617  0.123130 -0.430674
4  0.731902  0.511834  0.557020  0.231617  1.000000  0.286251  0.286065

distillery 3 (looks like 4 on the plot) has a very different flavor profile to first 3. In fact on the plot it has similar profiles only to 59 and 58 (which would be 58 and 57 via index) which also -vely correlate with almost all other flavor profiles.

#4.1.4 Clustering

- so that last correlation matrix held a lot of data that was a bit hard to easily decipher but we can cluster the data according to flavor profiles by using a clustering method from scikit-learn machine learning modu;e
- the method is spectral co-clustering
- think of a list of specific words and a list of documents. one of the words might be in all of the documents. There miht be words that if they occur in a document mean that certain other words definititley will too. And so on. 
- the goal is to find clusters of words and sets of ducuments that go together.
- co-clustering refers to the fact that we find both clusters of words AND cluysters of documents
- This is still a complex problem so the first step would be to define an adjacency matrix, where rows correspond to words and columns to documents and the value of any given element represents the number of times the word appears in the document.
- this matrix can be manipulated to find an approximate solution to the original clustering problem in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. (see linear algebra)
- this eigenvalue/vector component is where the spectral part of the name comes from
- you can think of spectral co-clustering as the simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a matrix
- in this example we will be finding clusters of whiskies in our correlation flavor matrix
