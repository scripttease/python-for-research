#4.1 pandas
oh god... more shitty pandas :(

- dataset contains a tasting rating for one readily available single malt whisky from almost every whisky distillery in scotland
- the data set contains 86 single malts
- htey are scored between 0 and 4 in 12 different taste categories, by 10 tatsters (and the score averages over the 10 tasters)
- categiries include sweet, spicy, smoky, medicinal etc
- pandas is for structured tabularised data
- two most important features are series and Dataframe
- series is a 1d array like object
- dataframe is a 2d, table like array-like object
- both contain additional info (metadata)as well as the data

questions: (just the one i got wrong)
In pandas , what does the reindex method do?
- Reorders the indices of a pandas Series object according to its argument

#4.1.2 loading and inspecting data
- change working ipython directory to file location helps
- can read data directly into a dataframe with pd.read_csv
#4.1.3 exploring correlations
- default correlation is the linear Pearson correlation 
- In other words, if you have measured attributes for two variables, let's call them x and y the Pearson correlation coefficient between x and y approaches plus 1 as the points in the xy scatterplot approach a straight upward line.
- a large +ve correlation coefficient indicates that x and y tend to increase or decrease togther so highly correlated.
/### Can use a single command to Compute pairwise the corerlation of columns in the flavors dataframe
- Assign output tp a variable called corr_flavors
- this one step makes a corelation matrix

```py
corr_flavors = pd.DataFrame.corr(flavors)
```
- can be used with transposed dataframes for other corellations in data:
```py
corr_whisky = pd.DataFrame.corr(flavors.transpose())
```
### how thsi works

Flavors was a reduced dataset containing 86 different flavor profiles. The colums were the flavors and the rows corresponded to each distillery. But. When we do a correlation on the transpose of  that what we get is 86 columns correspnding to each distillery with each row being a different flavor profile matrix:
In [128]: flavors.transpose()
Out[128]:
           0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  ...  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85
Body        2   3   1   4   2   2   0   2   2 ...   4   1   1   2   1   2   0   2   2
Sweetness   2   3   3   1   2   3   2   3   2 ...   2   2   3   2   1   3   3   2   3

Spicy       1   3   0   2   1   1   1   1   0 ...   3   0   2   2   0   2   2   0   2
Winey       2   2   0   0   1   1   0   2   0 ...   0   1   0   0   0   1   1   1   1

Malty       2   3   2   2   3   1   2   2   2 ...   2   2   1   0   2   2   2   1   2
Fruity      2   3   3   1   1   1   3   2   2 ...   2   2   2   2   2   0   1   0   2

[12 rows x 86 columns]

- So now the corelation matrix will compare each distillery based on its flavor profile:

In [126]: corr_whisky.head()
Out[126]:
         0         1         2     ...           83        84        85
0  1.000000  0.708632  0.697354    ...     0.504753  0.572186  0.267222
1  0.708632  1.000000  0.503074    ...     0.631655  0.372342  0.483030
2  0.697354  0.503074  1.000000    ...     0.545891  0.358457  0.303273
3 -0.147311 -0.228591 -0.140435    ...    -0.392074  0.145517 -0.101649
4  0.731902  0.511834  0.557020    ...     0.424397  0.695182  0.424397

So you see that distilleries 0 and 1 have quite a similar flavor profile. 
But look at this slice: 

In [137]: corr_whisky.iloc[:5, :7]
Out[137]:
          0         1         2         3         4         5         6
0  1.000000  0.708632  0.697354 -0.147311  0.731902  0.389086  0.464312
1  0.708632  1.000000  0.503074 -0.228591  0.511834  0.400983  0.460830
2  0.697354  0.503074  1.000000 -0.140435  0.557020  0.389627  0.730465
3 -0.147311 -0.228591 -0.140435  1.000000  0.231617  0.123130 -0.430674
4  0.731902  0.511834  0.557020  0.231617  1.000000  0.286251  0.286065

distillery 3 (looks like 4 on the plot) has a very different flavor profile to first 3. In fact on the plot it has similar profiles only to 59 and 58 (which would be 58 and 57 via index) which also -vely correlate with almost all other flavor profiles.

#4.1.4 Clustering
- spectral coclustering is a method for finding clusters of objects by the similarity of their attributes.
- so that last correlation matrix held a lot of data that was a bit hard to easily decipher but we can cluster the data according to flavor profiles by using a clustering method from scikit-learn machine learning modu;e
- the method is spectral co-clustering
- think of a list of specific words and a list of documents. one of the words might be in all of the documents. There miht be words that if they occur in a document mean that certain other words definititley will too. And so on. 
- the goal is to find clusters of words and sets of ducuments that go together.
- co-clustering refers to the fact that we find both clusters of words AND cluysters of documents
- This is still a complex problem so the first step would be to define an adjacency matrix, where rows correspond to words and columns to documents and the value of any given element represents the number of times the word appears in the document.
- this matrix can be manipulated to find an approximate solution to the original clustering problem in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. (see linear algebra)
- this eigenvalue/vector component is where the spectral part of the name comes from
- you can think of spectral co-clustering as the simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a matrix
- in this example we will be finding clusters of whiskies in our correlation flavor matrix
- this method will effectively reorder the rows and cols of the corr matrix so we can see blocks corresponding to groups more easily
- the whiskies in the dataset come from six regions so we will ask the clustering algo to form 6 blocks
- our clustering also will be named our model.
- the output is an array with dimensions: No of row clusters by no of rows in the data matrix (the corr matrix in this case)
- entries (examined using `model.rows_` 
- entries are either true or false
- there are 6 subarrays or rows in the array, numbering 0 to 5, these correspond to the clusters we asked for. each row has 86 columns (0 to 85) representing a ROW from the correlation matrix.
- summing all the columns in the array we can find out how many observations belong to each cluster.
- ths is done by:
```
np.sum(model.rows_, axis=1)
#Out[143]: array([20,  5, 19, 17,  6, 19])
```

- because axis 0 is rows and 1 is cloumns and we want to sum the columns.
- this tells us that 20 whiskies belong to cluster 0, 5 to cluster 1, 19 to cluster 2 and so on
- if we some all the ROWS we can find out how many clusters belong to each observation. Because each observation belongs in just one of the 6 clusters, the answer should be 1 for all of them and we can check this
```py

np.sum(model.rows_, axis=0)
#Out[144]:
array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
       1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
       1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
       1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
```

To see which observation (from 0 to 85) belongs to which cluster we can look at the labels


```py

model.row_labels_
# Out[145]:
# array([5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4,
#        3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2,
#        2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 4, 0, 3, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2,
#        1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0],
#       dtype=int32)
```
- so obs 0 belongs to cluster number 5, observation 1 belongs to cluster 2 and so on.

# 4.1.4 clustering whiskies by flavour profile questions

What is spectral co-clustering?
- A method for finding clusters of objects by the similarity of their attributes 

# 4.1.5 comparing correlation matrices
## And drawing clusters
-  extract the group labels from the model and append them to the whisky table, and specify theur indicies explicityly

```py
whisky['Group'] = pd.Series(model.row_labels_, index=whisky.index)
```
- reorder the the rows using the group labels from spectral co-clustering. order in increasing order:
#### Note that .ix (or .loc because ix is deprecated REORDERS the data but it does not actually change the indicies, just the order they appear in

```py
whisky = whisky.ix[np.argsort(model.row_labels_)]
# note that ix is deprecated and you should use either loc or iloc depending...
```
- finally reset the index of the dataframe
#### NOTE this permanently vhanges the indicies not just the order
```py
whisky = whisky.reset_index(drop=True)
```

- now the table is reordered according to cluster whereas before it was random

- Now we recreate the correlation matrix for the transposed flavours section of hte whisky dataframe (as before but on the reordered data)

```py
correlations = pd.DataFrame.corr(whisky.iloc[:, 2:14].transpose())
```
- now turn this from a dataframe into an array:
```py
correlations = np.array(correlations)
```
- now plot the original correlation coefficiets and the rearranged correlation coefficients which we would expect to form clusters

- what you get is if you follow the diagonal(in correlations.pdf) 6 blocks (not of equal size?) of what are 6 differnt groups of whiskies selected by the clustering model to be grouped according to their flavour profile. The data is the same it is just reordered

#4.1.5 questions on correlation matrices

Consider the following code:

import pandas as pd 
data = pd.Series([1,2,3,4]) 
data = data.ix[[3,0,1,2]]
What does data[0] return? Why?
- 1 : data.ix alters the order of appearance, but leaves the indices the same.

Consider the following code:

import pandas as pd 
data = pd.Series([1,2,3,4]) 
data = data.ix[[3,0,1,2]] 
data = data.reset_index(drop=True)
What does data[0] return? Why?
- 4 : The 0th index of the data has been reordered to index 3 of the original, which is 4.

### Helpful tips from discussion section:
- my colorbar was different from the lecturers. you can change this by using colormaps eg:
```py
plt.pcolor(corr_whiskies, cmap='rainbow')
```
