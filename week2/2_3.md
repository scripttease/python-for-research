# Matplotlib and Pyplot
## 2.3.1
- Matplotlib is very large and unwieldy
- Pyplot is a small collection of functions that make matplotlib work like Matlab
- Pyplot is good for interactive work
- Pyplot provides a *state machine* interface to matplotlib library
    - ie you create figures one at a time and all commands affect rge current figure and plot
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#2.3.2
- labels etc
- pyplot knows latex
- so using $x$ instead of 'x' just gives a slightly posher font
- saves in current directory that ipython is in
#2.3.3
- semilog plots one axis in log scale
- loglog plots both on a log scale
- log plots are useful because when you have an exponent x to the power alpha then taking logs of both axes will mean that your gradient (i think) is alpha. or something anyway you end up with instead of y = x to the alpha with y' = alpha * x' (where prime denotes logs)
- logspace is like linspace but obviously spaced evenly on a log scale.
#2.3.4 Histograms
- useful note: np.random.normal(size=x) generates x random numbers BUT the mean of them all ==0 and variance ==1 (ie they form a normal distribution)
- by default hist uses 10 evely spaced bins but there are tons of options to make histograms and you can google plt.hist to find them
- use normed=True to get proportion per bin and to choose your number of bins use eg linspace. If you wanted 20 bins between -5 and plus 5 you would do bine=np.linspace(-5,5,21) (because bin is a width thing so thats effectifely 20 widths denoted by 21 points. eg if you wanted one bin it would have 2 points a start and a finish point)
- gamma distribution also exists in numpy ( continous probability fn that goes from 0 to plus infinity)
- subplot lets you have subplots in each figure
- so you can have say 4 realted plots on one plot
#2.4.1 simulating randomness
- random choice takes a sequence so you could simulate a coin like this
```py
random.choice([0,1])
```
- or a die like this:
```py
random.choice(range(1,7))
```
- but becareful if you simulated a die like this:
```py
random.choice([range(1,7)])
```
what you are asking for is a random item from the list that contains 1 item only (which is a range but still a range is one item and you will always get that back)
- to simulate having three dice, one 6 sided one 8 sided and one 10 sided and choosing one at random then throwing that one at random you could do:

```py
random.choice(random.choice([range(1,7),range(1,9),range(1,11)]))
```
- basically this works because in python everything is an object
