#3.1.1 Dna
### dna primer:
- dna can be representated by a 1d string of characters either A, C, T or G
- these are nucleotide bases
- to form the base pairs in a strand of dna, A alwats pairs with T and C always pairs with G so you only need one strand to encode the entire base pair
- three bases in a row (a nucleotide triplet) encode an amino acid
- each protein has a unique sequence of amino acids
- ALL dna-encoded proteins are built from just 20 amino acids (there are 2 others, made by proteins themselves)
- BUT a protein can be any length of amino acids
- DNA is transcribed to rna and rna is transcribed to proteins

## What we will do:
- Download a dna sequence
- translate to amino acids
- download the aa sequence to test our code

- Concepts
    - a 4 letter alphabet that we read in 3 letter 'words'
    - each word can be represented by a single letter that is an amino acid

- For example: (DNA to amino acid)
ATA -> I
ATG -> M
CAA -> Q
TCT -> S
TGG -> W

- Tasks
    - manually downlaos dna data and protein sequence
    - import data to python
    - create algorithm to translate the dna
    - check if code translation matches protein sequence
    - (A chart for dna triplet to amino acid also needed)

#3.1.2 downloading dna data
-The NCBI is the National Center for Biotechnology Information, main public dna repo

- File 1 = strand of dna
- file 2 corresponding protein sequence
- (retreive nucleotide NM_207618.2.)

#3.1.3 importing data into python
- for large files that you only want part of you can read in in a for loop and either process the line or skip it
- you can also read the whole file (see.py file)

#3.1.4 translating the dna
- its a lookup table operation
- the perfect thing for this in pyton is a dict (dictionary)

### Pseducode:
  - check length of seq is divisible by 3
  - look up each 3 letter string in table and store result
  - continue til end of seq

#3.1.5 Comparison and file read with WITH
- with is a better way to read a file - prevebts errors, copes with things going wrong

```py
inputfile = 'dna.txt'
with open(inputfile, 'r') as f:
    seq = f.read
```
