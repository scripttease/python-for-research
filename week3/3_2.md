# 3.2.1 Language processing
- looking at how book length, number of unique words and how attributes cluster by language/author
- Project guttenberg - oldest digital library of books, archives cultural works, contains 50000+ books
- in public domain
- course has downloaded a slecetion of over 100 titles for this case study, nested into folders
- top nest is language, next is authors and next is books
### Goal:
- write a fn that given a string of text counts the number of times each unique word appears
- dictionary is obvious way to do this
- keys are words (strings) and vals are count
#3.2.2 counting words
- useful to have a test string
- collections.counter is useful
```py
from collections import Counter
```

# 3.2.3 reading in a book (see .py file)
# 3.2.4 computing word freq stats

# 3.2.5 Reading multiple files
- import os module to allow reading of dirs/folders
```py
import os
```
- the pandas lib name comes from the term panal data used to refer to multi-dimensional structured data sets.
- It's especially useful for manipulating numerical tables and time series data.
- we can use a pandas dataframe for our word stats for all the books we read in

# 3.2.6 plotting book stats
